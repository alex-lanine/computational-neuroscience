# Computational Neuroscience Course Projects

This repository contains projects and code developed as part of a computational neuroscience course. The projects explore key concepts and techniques in computational neuroscience, including neural dynamics, network models, and the analysis of neural systems.

## Repository Structure

Three folders corresponding to each of the three projects. 
Each contains report and code used. 

- `Neural_Analysis/`: Covers generation and analysis of spike trains, integrate and fire model, Hodgkin Huxley.
- `Dynamical_Systems/`: Analysis and simulation of neural network dynamics. Covers 2D networks, Hopfield Networks, the Ring Attractor and PCA.
- `Decision_Making/`: Drift Diffusion Model and RNN Models of Decision Making
